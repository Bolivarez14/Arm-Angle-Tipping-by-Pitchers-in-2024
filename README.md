# Arm-Angle-Tipping-by-Pitchers-in-2024

FINAL RESULTS ARE IN THE SLIDE FILE.
Project Goal & Purpose:
Find pitchers who have different arm angles on differing pitches that could be seen as “pitch tipping” during the 2024 season. For hitters: To recognize the incoming pitch before the ball is released. The extra tenth of a second can be used to jump on pitches for a better batted result. For pitchers: To identify weak points in their pitching delivery. Also can be used to identify pitches that might have good movement but not great results against batters due to the lack of pitch tunneling.
